			<h2 class="c">INTB first to the Finals</h2>
			<p class="x">Mindanao may have finally found the team that could posibly carry their hopes to Class S next leg,<br> as Cagayan De Oro's It's In The Bag (INTB; formerly Comeback is Real) dominated Extreme<br> Gaming Philippines (EXG) 2-0 in the winner bracket finals in order to be the first team through to<br> the Class A Grand Finals.<br><br>

The boys from CDO went out all-guns blazing in the series opener, as they were able to draft<br> multiple meta favorites, particularly Leshrac for Levi, their midlaner. Levi proceeded to take care of<br> business as expected, as he dominated Stressed's Shadow Fiend in order to pace his team<br> towards a good midgame. There, they created enough space for up-and-coming star carry *xLiM <br>on his Anti-Mage. Once the AM went online, EXG had no choice but to call gg, and hope that they<br> could recover just in time for the second game.</p>

			<p class="x">Unfortunately for the teams based off Mandaluyong, the second game was nothing <br>short of a coming out party for xLiM, whose Phatntom Lancer this time around provided the very<br> difference between a win and a loss for INTB. Despite being pressured early on in the laning <br>phase, as wellas participating in most teamfights, xLiM raced to a 10K+ gold lead over his <br>EXG counterpart, propelling his team to finally claim their trip to the finals. The rising star<br> finished the series with an accumulated kill-score of 25-1-16, for a 41 KDA rating.</p>

			<p class="x">After over a year of having no team from Mindanao enter Class S, the battlefield of<br> the big boys, with only Cebu's Arcanys to represent the entire Southern half of the <br>archipelago, Marix's INTB squad now shines as a new hope for Mindanao. However, they have to<br> claim two more wins before they can challenge Arcanys for Class S standing.<br><br>

Class A finals is next week, September 29. INTB enter the bo5 with a 1-0 advantage by virtue of topping the<br> upper bracket. INTB take on whoever will make it out of the lower bracket finals between EXG and Raging WePlay.</p>
