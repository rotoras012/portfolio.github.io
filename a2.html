			<h1 class="c">What Should We Expect At The KL Major SEA Qualifiers?</h1>
			<p class="x">Get your bodies ready for the 2018-2019 Dota Pro Circuit season<br>



Tuesday, September 18, 2018 8:00 PM<br>
We all witnessed how this year's roster shuffle has unfolded and Southeast Asia has pretty much retained its status as one of the most <br>competitive region in professional Dota 2. Now, we're about to see the aftermath of the annual shuffle as the closed qualifier for the first <br>Major tournament of the 2018-2019 Dota Pro Circuit, The Kuala Lumpur Major, starts tomorrow.<br><br>

To give you a heads up of what's about to come, we have listed down the things that should go down at The Kuala Lumpur Major SEA Qualifiers.<br><br></p>

			<h2 class="c">TNC Predator Versus Lotac</h2>
			<p class="x">Raven joining Ohaiyo's new team was the biggest let down of the region's roster shuffle. We were all hyped when all the rumor mills hinted <br>that SEA's superstar carry will be moving to Europe to join Puppey in Team Secret, but instead, he joined Team Lotac. His move may not be as <br>bad as it sounds, but aside from it being a huge downgrade on the potential "Secret.Raven", it may also not be a total upgrade compared to <br>TNC Predator. (Actually, it may be as bad as it sounds.)</p>

				<h2 class="c">The Return of All-Filipino Dota 2 Teams</h2>
				<p class="x">
For several years, TNC Predator has been the sole Filipino representative in international tournaments. It's been a long while since the last<br> time they had a brother that can help wave the Filipino flag in the higher echelons of professional Dota 2 competitions, especially after <br>the rise of SEA powerhouses.<br><br>

But this time at The Kuala Lumpur Major SEA Qualifiers, TNC Predator have brought in some reinforcements. Half of the teams that will be <br>fighting for the region's slots are Philippine-based Dota 2 teams with an all-Filipino lineup: TNC Predator, Execration, Sterling Global <br>Dragons, and Admiral Dota.<br><br>

The last two teams that completed the closed qualifier of the 2018-2019 Dota Pro Circuit's Major qualifiers hailed from the grueling open <br>qualifiers. Despite their seemingly unheard names. SG Dragons and Admiral Dota are no longer strangers in competitive gaming. Both teams are <br>composed of with the right mix of veteran and rising Filipino talents.<br><br>

In fact, Admiral Dota will even represent the Philippines at Singapore's biggest esports event of the year, the PVP Esports Championship.<br>
