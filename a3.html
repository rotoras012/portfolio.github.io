The first Dota Pro Circuit concluded as one of the most unforgiving seasons for Ryan Jay “Raging Potato” Qui. Devoted fans were deprived of<br> the Philippines’ Most Explosive Player’s daily dose of explosiveness as he would only appear at non-Dota Pro Circuit events or, if fate would <br>have it, Dota Pro Circuit regional qualifiers.<br><br>

Earlier this year, we saw how TaskUs Titans emerged as the Dota 2 champions of the Globe Philippine Pro Gaming League, a nationwide esports <br>tournament which features multiple esports titles across various gaming platforms, under the leadership of Raging Potato. It was a lopsided <br>victory on their part, losing only one game during their entire tournament run, but that was pretty much the highlight of Raging Potato and <br>TaskUs Titans’ season.
