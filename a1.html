Five months ago, we witnessed Fnatic Dota and TNC Predator play three best-of-five series for three various regional qualifier finals of three<br>different Dota Pro Circuit tournaments. Grueling is one word to describe that weekend, but more than that, it ultimately proved how<br> dominant both teams were compared to their Southeast Asian contenders.<br><br>

Today, Fnatic Dota and TNC Predator have notched the region’s slots for The Kuala Lumpur Major, the first Major tournament of the 2018-2019<br> Dota Pro Circuit.<br><br>

Fnatic achieved their latest feat without even losing a single series. They easily topped the group stages of the qualifiers against the<br> revitalized Tigers and Sterling Global Dragons, the budding all-Filipino Dota 2 squad. In the playoffs, Fnatic seemed to have forgotten how to<br> lose. The remaining all-Filipino squads, Team Admiral and TNC Predator, were proved to be no match against Fnatic. After only five games,<br> Fnatic secured their slot at The Kuala Lumpur Major.</p>
